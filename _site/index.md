# Astro465 - Optical Astronomy

## Overview

In a nutshell, as part of this astro lab you will become familiar with several
basic, but powerful observing techniques commonly used in astronomy, and how
to process the resulting data from raw, instrumental data to scientific
results.

* [Basics of CCD astronomy](intro_observing)
* [Introduction to astronomical observing, roof-top observatory](intro_observatory/)
* [Handling of CCD imaging data in python and astropy](python_astropy/)
* [Develop a basic data reduction pipeline: bias, dark, and flat-field correction](reduction_pipeline/)
* [Source detection and photometry](detection_photometry)
* [Observing project: Surface photometry of galaxies](project_galaxy)
* [Observing project: Stellar photometry of stars](project_starcluster)
* [Time-series photometry of variable stars or exo-planet host stars](project_lightcurve)
* [Highlight project of your choice](project_highlight)


## Project 1: Integrated surface photometry of stars

In this project bla bla bla. See more details on [this
page](project_galaxy/)


## Project 2: Resolved photometry and age-dating of a star cluster

## Project 3: Time-series photometry of astronomical sources
